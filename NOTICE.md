## What This Is

The BordneAI Research Engine v3.3.1 is a **governance specification and reference architecture** for evidence-based inquiry.

### Explicitly NOT:

- ❌ Executable code or software
- ❌ Model weights or neural network parameters
- ❌ Production-certified or safety-approved system
- ❌ A substitute for professional judgment, expertise, or consultation
- ❌ A conspiracy framework or alternative epistemology
- ❌ A replacement for domain-specific standards and ethics

### Explicitly IS:

- ✅ Instructional documentation for how to treat evidence
- ✅ A framework for transparent reasoning under uncertainty
- ✅ Applicable across any domain where ambiguity or conflict exists
- ✅ A reference implementation for those building AI systems
- ✅ Governed by CC BY 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution)

## Safety & Scope Limitations

### What This Framework Cannot Do

1. **Access classified material.** The framework cannot retrieve, analyze, or confirm claims about sealed or classified records. It can discuss why classification exists, but cannot access what is classified.

2. **Resolve unknowns.** When a question's answer is unknown, the framework acknowledges this. It does not speculate beyond what evidence supports.

3. **Guarantee accuracy.** The framework applies rigorous methods, but is not immune to error. Outputs should be verified against authoritative sources in your domain.

4. **Substitute for professional judgment.** In medicine, law, finance, security, and other professional domains, this framework informs analysis but does not replace qualified professionals. Always consult appropriately-credentialed experts for consequential decisions.

5. **Resolve philosophical disputes.** Questions of value, meaning, or preference ultimately lie outside the scope of evidence-based frameworks.

6. **Provide real-time data.** Without access to live web services or current databases, assessments are limited by knowledge cutoff dates.

### When Professional Consultation Is Required

**Medical/Health Questions:**
- Consult a physician, licensed healthcare provider, or mental health professional
- This framework is for educational understanding, not medical guidance
- Individual health circumstances vary; medical decisions require professional assessment

**Legal Questions:**
- Consult an attorney licensed in your jurisdiction
- This framework is for legal understanding, not legal advice
- Laws vary by jurisdiction; professional counsel is essential

**Financial Questions:**
- Consult a financial advisor or professional
- This framework is informational, not financial advice
- Investment decisions require professional assessment of your circumstances

**Security/Safety-Critical Questions:**
- Consult qualified security professionals
- This framework is analytical, not operational guidance
- Safety-critical systems require professional risk assessment

**Policy/Regulatory Questions:**
- Consult regulatory experts or compliance professionals
- This framework is for policy understanding, not compliance guidance
- Regulatory requirements vary by context

## How Outputs Should Be Used

### Appropriate Uses

- ✅ Educational and informational purposes
- ✅ Research and background understanding
- ✅ Initial analysis prior to professional consultation
- ✅ Reference for how to think about evidence and uncertainty
- ✅ Framework implementation in other AI systems
- ✅ Learning how tiered sourcing and governance apply to your domain

### Inappropriate Uses

- ❌ Medical decisions without physician consultation
- ❌ Legal decisions without attorney consultation
- ❌ Financial decisions without professional financial advice
- ❌ Safety-critical decisions without qualified expert review
- ❌ Relying on outputs as definitive answers in high-stakes domains
- ❌ Treating framework as basis for rejecting professional expertise

## Limitations & Disclaimers

### Scope Limitations

This framework:
- Prioritizes T1/T2 (primary sources and peer-reviewed research) but cannot create evidence that doesn't exist
- Acknowledges uncertainty explicitly rather than hiding it
- Does not presume what topics are acceptable (you specify domains)
- Applies best efforts to evidence-based reasoning but guarantees nothing

### Individual Variation

Outputs describe general evidence bases but do not account for:
- Individual health conditions, genetics, and circumstances
- Jurisdictional variations in law
- Personal risk tolerance and preferences
- Organizational context and constraints
- Local cultural and professional norms

**Always apply professional judgment and context to generic outputs.**

### Time Sensitivity

This framework reflects information current as of its release date (2025-11-17). For:
- Scientific claims: newer research may contradict older assessments
- Policy claims: regulations and laws change
- Technology claims: systems evolve rapidly
- Medical claims: treatment guidelines evolve
- Market claims: conditions change continuously

**Always verify time-sensitive claims against current authoritative sources.**

---

## What The Framework Does Not Imply

- 🚫 That absence of evidence is evidence of suppression
- 🚫 That institutional silence proves hidden truth
- 🚫 That documented facts are conspiracies
- 🚫 That experts who disagree are covering something up
- 🚫 That marginal evidence should outweigh mainstream research
- 🚫 That distrust in institutions justifies distrust in evidence

## Governing Philosophy

This framework is designed to:

1. **Make reasoning transparent** — how evidence is weighted, what is known, what remains unknown
2. **Enable correction** — when new information contradicts earlier assessment, update explicitly
3. **Prioritize documents over narratives** — verifiable sources over storytelling
4. **Acknowledge limits** — when evidence is insufficient, say so rather than speculate
5. **Govern reasoning, not conclusions** — enable evidence-based inquiry regardless of topic

It does **not** enforce particular worldviews, political positions, or conclusions.

---

## Summary

**Use this framework for:** Evidence-based reasoning, learning, research, and analytical guidance across any domain.

**Do not use this framework as:** A substitute for professional expertise, medical/legal/financial advice, or a reason to disregard qualified professionals.

**Remember:** This framework informs analysis. Humans make decisions. Professional judgment and local context always apply.
