# NOTICE

## What This Repository Is

The BordneAI Research Engine is a **governance specification and instructional document** for evidence-based inquiry into historically complex, institutionally sensitive domains. It describes operational guidelines, sourcing hierarchies, and safety frameworks for a specialized research assistant.

This repository is **not**:
- Executable code or software
- A runtime environment or deployable system
- Production-certified or safety-approved for critical systems
- Intended for high-stakes adversarial or destructive contexts
- A framework for assuming hidden content without evidence

## Scope of Content

This repository contains:

- **Governance specifications** (SYSTEM_PROMPT-v3.0.md, SOURCING_PROFILE_V2.1.md, GOVERNANCE.md)
- **Documentation of reasoning frameworks** (docs/domains.md, docs/structural-secrecy.md)
- **Illustrative examples** (docs/examples.md)
- **Operational guidelines** (prompts/, configuration notes)

It does **not** include:
- Executable code to compile or run
- Neural network weights, embeddings, or model parameters
- Proprietary implementation details
- Vulnerability information or exploit code
- Classified material (all examples use declassified or public sources)

## Key Disclaimers

### 1. Specification, Not Software
This is an instructional document describing how a research system *should* behave. It is not software. Readers are responsible for their own implementations, security practices, and operational oversight.

### 2. Not Safety-Certified
This repository documents governance principles but **is not certified or approved** for:
- Critical infrastructure security decisions
- Nuclear command & control applications
- National security operations
- Military or intelligence deployment
- Any context where human error could cause significant harm

Organizations using principles from this specification must conduct independent safety review and validation.

### 3. Institutional Secrecy Is Legitimate
This system **respects institutional secrecy** as a normal, often justified practice. It does **not**:
- Assume hidden documents contain specific content
- Frame sealed records as proof of conspiracy
- Speculate about classified material
- Encourage circumventing proper classification procedures

The distinction: "This record is classified" is not the same as "This record definitely contains evidence of X."

### 4. Misuse Warning
Use of this framework in high-stakes, adversarial, or destructive contexts is **not supported**. Examples of unsupported uses:
- Generating persuasive-sounding misinformation
- Automating surveillance or targeting of individuals
- Circumventing legitimate security boundaries
- Mass-producing false or misleading content
- Evading detection in security contexts

If you observe this system being misused for the above purposes, please report it via the contact information below.

### 5. No Guarantee of Accuracy
The examples and methodologies in this repository are illustrative. No guarantee is provided regarding:
- Factual accuracy of historical examples
- Completeness of sourcing guidance
- Absence of errors or outdated information
- Appropriateness for uses not explicitly intended

Users are responsible for independent fact-checking and validation.

## Attribution & Reuse

### You Must Provide Attribution
If you use, adapt, or reference this work, you must provide the following attribution in a prominent location:

> BordneAI Research Engine by David Bordne, licensed under CC BY 4.0

See LICENSE.md for full attribution requirements.

### Derivative Works & Modifications
If you create an adapted or modified version:
- Clearly indicate what changes were made
- Maintain the CC BY 4.0 attribution
- Provide the same disclaimers (or stronger ones)
- Do not misrepresent the original work

### No Endorsement
Using this specification does not constitute endorsement by David Bordne or the BordneAI project of your implementation, use case, or application.

## Limitations & Caveats

### Domain Scope
This system is designed for **historical and institutional analysis** in specific domains (nuclear history, intelligence oversight, UAP analysis, scientific anomalies). It is not designed for:
- General question-answering
- Entertainment or creative fiction
- Real-time operational support
- Replacing expert human judgment

### Evidence Incompleteness
All domains discussed in this repository have significant evidence gaps and contested interpretations. The existence of this framework does **not** resolve those disputes. It provides a method for reasoning about incomplete information, not answers to inherently undecidable questions.

### Temporal Limitation
This specification (v3.0-alpha) reflects understanding and declassification as of **2025-11-17**. Significant new declassifications or institutional disclosures may render portions outdated. Check CHANGELOG.md for version updates.

## Responsible Use

### If You Implement This Framework
- Conduct independent safety review appropriate to your context
- Establish human oversight procedures
- Audit outputs for accuracy before public use
- Monitor for adversarial misuse
- Report errors via the feedback mechanisms described in GOVERNANCE.md

### If You Report Issues
- Report security concerns, prompt injection vulnerabilities, or alignment problems to BordneAI@bordne.com
- Allow reasonable time for response before public disclosure
- Provide sufficient detail for the team to reproduce and verify the issue
- Do not use issue reports as a vector for attacks or social engineering

### If You Modify or Adapt This Work
- Maintain transparency about your modifications
- Do not attribute your errors or limitations to the original work
- Provide comparable security and attribution disclosures
- Consider contributing improvements back to the original project
