# Sourcing Profile v2.1

## Complete Guide to the Tiered Sourcing Hierarchy (T1-T4)

---

## Overview

The tiered sourcing hierarchy is the foundation of the BordneAI Research Engine. Every claim is classified by source tier, and every tier has explicit confidence levels and handling rules.

**Core Principle:** Source tier indicates confidence level and handling procedure. No tier is universally privileged; tier relevance depends on domain and the specific question.

---

## Tier 1: Primary Evidence & Official Sources

### Definition
T1 sources are primary evidence with direct authority. They are:
- **Firsthand** (not relayed through intermediaries)
- **Official** (generated by legitimate institutional authority)
- **Original** (not interpreted or summarized by others)
- **Verified** (authenticity confirmed through institutional or technical means)

### Characteristics

| Characteristic | Details |
|---|---|
| **Primary vs. Secondary** | Primary evidence; original document or direct observation |
| **Authority** | Official authority with jurisdiction over the subject |
| **Accessibility** | Often public, sometimes declassified or under legal access |
| **Provenance** | Clear chain of custody; source authenticity verifiable |
| **Format** | Documents, transcripts, declassified records, official statements, observational data |
| **Confidence Baseline** | Highest (subject to verification of source authenticity) |

### Examples (Generic)

#### Government & Institution Sources
- Declassified government documents with release dates and declassification authority
- Congressional testimony given under oath, with official transcript
- Court documents from legal proceedings (filings, judgments, transcripts)
- Official policy statements released by authorized government agency
- Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) releases with document IDs
- Military or intelligence community reports with declassification markings

#### Research & Scientific Sources
- Primary research data with experimental methodology documented
- Technical specifications released by equipment manufacturers
- Engineering reports with design specifications and test results
- Observational data from scientific instruments (satellite, telescope, etc.) with metadata

#### Institutional Records
- Personnel records from authorized institutional archives
- Meeting minutes from official institutional proceedings
- Financial records from audited institutional accounts
- Administrative records documenting institutional decisions

### Sourcing Rules for T1

1. **Authenticity Verification**: Verify that the source is authentic
   - Check publication source (official website, archive, legal database)
   - Confirm release date and classification status
   - Verify chain of custody for sensitive documents

2. **Temporal Specificity**: Record exactly when the source was created and when it was accessed
   - Format: `as_of: YYYY-MM-DD`
   - Note: "Accessed 2025-11-17; originally created 1985-03-14"

3. **Full Citation**: Include all identifying information
   - Document ID (if exists)
   - Classification status (declassified, public, etc.)
   - Release authority (agency, court, archive)
   - Access location (URL, archive, repository)

4. **Internal Contradictions**: If multiple T1 sources conflict, flag it explicitly
   - "Two T1 sources provide conflicting accounts: [Source A says X], [Source B says Y]"
   - Do not pick one without justification
   - Treat conflict as evidence of complexity, not as a failure

5. **Contextual Metadata**: Include surrounding context
   - Who authored the document? With what authority?
   - Who was it released by? Under what circumstances?
   - What was redacted? Why (if known)?

### When T1 is Preferred
- **Domain**: Contested institutional decisions, declassified records, official statements
- **Question Type**: "What did institution X do/decide/state?"
- **Evidence**: Direct evidence of institutional action or position

### Citation Format
```
[T1: agency/institution + document_id, created: YYYY-MM-DD, accessed: YYYY-MM-DD,
declassification_status: PUBLIC/DECLASSIFIED/sealed, confidence: X%]
```

**Example Citation:**
```
[T1: State Department FOIA #2023-1847, created: 1982-05-15, accessed: 2025-06-10,
declassification_status: DECLASSIFIED_2015, confidence: 95%]
```

## Tier 2: Peer-Reviewed & High-Quality Preprint Literature

### Definition
T2 sources are validated research through academic peer review or transparent preprint methodology. They are:
- **Peer-Reviewed** (journal articles vetted by expert reviewers) OR **Transparent Preprints** (explicit methodology, author credentials, open-source data)
- **Methodological** (clear methodology, transparent reasoning)
- **Credentialed** (author expertise in relevant domain)
- **Replicable** (methodology transparent enough for independent verification)

### Characteristics

| Characteristic | Details |
|---|---|
| **Validation** | Peer review OR transparent preprint methodology |
| **Authority** | Expert knowledge; credentialed authors |
| **Methodology** | Explicit, transparent, documented |
| **Scope** | Single topic; focus on verifiable claims |
| **Peer Scrutiny** | Reviewed by domain experts (for peer-reviewed); or transparent for preprints |
| **Replicability** | Sufficient detail for independent replication |
| **Confidence Baseline** | High (depends on peer-review rigor and methodology quality) |

### Sub-Tiers Within T2

#### T2a: Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles
- Published in established peer-reviewed journals
- Subject to editorial standards and peer review
- Methodology vetted by independent experts
- Empirical claims tested and validated

**Quality Hierarchy:**
- Top-tier journals (high rejection rate, rigorous review): Confidence 85-95%
- Mid-tier journals (moderate review standards): Confidence 70-85%
- Lower-tier journals (less rigorous standards): Confidence 60-75%

#### T2b: High-Quality Preprints
- ArXiv, bioRxiv, or other transparent repositories
- Authors identified with institutional affiliations
- Methodology fully documented and source data available
- Usually posted with intention for peer-reviewed publication

**Quality Assessment:**
- Preprint with author credentials and transparent data: Confidence 70-85%
- Preprint with limited methodology detail: Confidence 50-70%

#### T2c: Academic Monographs
- Published by established academic presses (university, major academic publisher)
- Author expertise in relevant domain
- Peer-reviewed or editorially vetted
- Cites T1 sources and research literature

**Quality Assessment:**
- University press with editorial review: Confidence 75-85%
- Academic monograph with author track record: Confidence 70-80%

#### T2d: Technical Reports from Credentialed Institutes
- Think tank reports with explicit methodology
- Industry research with transparent methodology
- Government research reports with clear author credentials
- Reports that cite underlying data and methodology

**Quality Assessment:**
- Independent institute with transparent methodology: Confidence 75-85%
- Affiliated institute with potential bias: Confidence 60-75% (note bias)

### Sourcing Rules for T2

1. **Identify Sub-Tier**: Distinguish between peer-reviewed (T2a), preprint (T2b), monograph (T2c), and technical report (T2d)
   - Different sub-tiers have different confidence baselines
   - Adjust citation accordingly

2. **Assess Methodology**: Evaluate methodological quality
   - Is methodology explicit? Is it sound?
   - Is sample size adequate? Are statistical methods appropriate?
   - Are limitations acknowledged?

3. **Check for Author Expertise**: Verify author credentials in relevant domain
   - Is author published in the field? Does author have institutional affiliation?
   - Check conflict of interest (financial, institutional, or ideological bias)

4. **Review Peer-Review Rigor**: For peer-reviewed, assess journal quality
   - What is the journal's impact factor, rejection rate?
   - What is the reputation of the editorial board?
   - How recent is the publication?

5. **Evaluate Citation Practices**: Check that the T2 source cites its own sources
   - Does it cite T1 or other T2 sources?
   - Are citations to its claims explicit?
   - Does it distinguish fact from interpretation?

6. **Note Contradictions**: If multiple T2 sources disagree, cite both
   - "T2 sources disagree: [Source A concludes X], [Source B concludes Y]"
   - Older studies are not automatically inferior to newer ones
   - Disagreement is evidence of active research, not methodological failure

### When T2 is Preferred
- **Domain**: Novel scientific research, contemporary policy analysis, technical analysis
- **Question Type**: "What does research show about X?"
- **Evidence**: Established research findings; empirical claims with methodology

### Citation Format
```
[T2_peer: author_name, journal_name, volume(issue), pages, DOI, published: YYYY-MM-DD,
methodology_quality: X/10, confidence: Y%]

[T2_preprint: author_name, repository, preprint_id, DOI, methodology_quality: X/10,
confidence: Y%]

[T2_monograph: author_name, publisher, year, ISBN, author_credentials: X, confidence: Y%]

[T2_report: institute, report_id, year, methodology_transparency: X/10, confidence: Y%]
```

**Example Citations:**
```
[T2_peer: Smith et al., Nature Physics, 45(3), 234-241, DOI:10.1038/nphys.2024.1001,
published: 2024-06-15, methodology_quality: 9/10, confidence: 90%]

[T2_preprint: Johnson, arXiv, arXiv:2501.12345, DOI:10.48550/arXiv.2501.12345,
methodology_quality: 8/10, confidence: 80%]
```

## Tier 3: Reputable Secondary Sources

### Definition
T3 sources are credible secondhand accounts with institutional backing but no formal peer review. They are:
- **Established** (published by recognized institutions or media outlets)
- **Credible** (source has reputation for accuracy)
- **Sourced** (cite underlying evidence, primarily T1 or T2)
- **Interpretive** (add analysis or synthesis, not original research)

### Characteristics

| Characteristic | Details |
|---|---|
| **Primary vs. Secondary** | Secondary; interprets or synthesizes primary sources |
| **Authority** | Institutional credibility; established publication or author |
| **Sourcing** | Should cite underlying T1/T2 sources |
| **Bias Risk** | Higher than T1/T2; institutional, political, or financial bias possible |
| **Accessibility** | Widely available; usually public sources |
| **Confidence Baseline** | Medium (depends on source credibility and source transparency) |

### Examples (Generic)

#### Books & Monographs (Non-Peer-Reviewed)
- Historical monographs by recognized scholars (not peer-reviewed, but scholarly)
- Biographies and historical narratives by established authors
- Policy analysis books published by major publishers
- Investigative journalism books by established journalists

#### Journalism & Media
- News articles from established media outlets
- Long-form journalism and investigations from major publications
- Magazine articles from recognized publications
- Documentary sources and recorded interviews

#### Encyclopedic & Reference Sources
- Encyclopedia entries on historical or scientific topics
- Wikipedia articles (cite underlying references, not Wikipedia itself)
- Specialized encyclopedias (medical, historical, scientific)
- Reference works with editorial review

#### Industry & Think Tank Reports
- Policy reports from established think tanks (non-university affiliated)
- Industry analysis from market research firms
- White papers from established organizations
- Commissioned reports with clear authorship

### Sourcing Rules for T3

1. **Identify Source Credibility**: Assess the T3 source's reputation
   - Is the publication established? What is its track record?
   - Is the author credentialed? Does author have subject expertise?
   - Are there known biases (institutional, political, financial)?

2. **Trace Underlying Sources**: Do not use T3 as primary evidence
   - Check: Does the T3 source cite T1/T2 sources?
   - If T3 makes a claim about facts, try to find the T1/T2 source
   - If T3 cannot trace to T1/T2, lower confidence accordingly

3. **Distinguish Fact from Interpretation**: T3 mixes fact and analysis
   - Factual claims (should trace to T1/T2): Higher confidence
   - Interpretive claims (editorial analysis): Lower confidence
   - Flag the distinction in your citation

4. **Assess Potential Bias**: Note institutional, political, or financial biases
   - Is the T3 source financially motivated to reach a particular conclusion?
   - Does the T3 source have political or institutional incentives?
   - Does the T3 source have a track record of bias?

5. **Multiple T3 Sources**: Consensus vs. Disagreement
   - T3 consensus on facts: Reasonable to use as secondary confirmation
   - T3 disagreement on interpretation: Expected; interpret as analytical diversity
   - Always prefer to trace back to T1/T2

### When T3 is Appropriate
- **Domain**: Historical context, institutional background, policy overview
- **Question Type**: "What is the background on X?" or "How do experts interpret X?"
- **Evidence**: Context and interpretation; not core factual claims

### When T3 is NOT Appropriate
- **Contested Core Claims**: Do not use T3 as primary evidence for contested facts
- **Factual Disputes**: If T1/T2 exists, use those instead
- **Sensitive Analysis**: For contested domains, require T1/T2 foundation

### Citation Format
```
[T3: author_name/publication, publisher/outlet, year, underlying_sources: T1/T2_reference,
author_credentials: X, potential_bias: Y, confidence: Z%]
```

**Example Citations:**
```
[T3: Historical Society publication, "History of Policy X", 2020, underlying_sources: cite T1
documents S1, S2; T2 Smith et al., author_credentials: historical institute,
potential_bias: institutional affiliation with policy proponent, confidence: 65%]

[T3: Major News Outlet, investigative series, 2023, underlying_sources: T1 FOIA documents,
T2 academic research; journalist_track_record: established, confidence: 75%]
```

## Tier 4: Direct Testimony

### Definition
T4 sources are direct eyewitness accounts, interviews, or firsthand testimony. They are:
- **Direct** (personal observation or experience)
- **Unmediated** (not reviewed by institution)
- **Attributed** (can be named or anonymous)
- **Unvalidated** (no institutional or peer validation)

### Characteristics

| Characteristic | Details |
|---|---|
| **Authenticity** | Not independently verified |
| **Authority** | Witness or participant in event |
| **Bias Risk** | High; memory, perspective, or motivation bias |
| **Corroboration** | Often stands alone; may be contradicted by T1/T2 |
| **Value** | Provides insider perspective; must be weighted carefully |
| **Confidence Baseline** | Lowest (depends on corroboration and credibility markers) |

### Sub-Tiers Within T4

#### T4a: Named Testimony with Credentials (T4_named)
Eyewitness or participant with:
- **Identified name** and **verifiable identity**
- **Relevant credentials** or **professional history**
- **Direct involvement** in the event or domain

**Credibility Factors:**
- High-level professional (confirmed position): Confidence 40-60%
- Professional with relevant expertise: Confidence 30-50%
- Ordinary participant/witness: Confidence 20-40%
- Credibility reduced by: conflicts of interest, obvious bias, lack of relevant knowledge

**Example:** "Dr. [Name], Director of [Institution], states [testimony]. Credentials verified; potential bias: institutional affiliation."

#### T4b: Anonymous Testimony (T4_anon)
Eyewitness or participant who is:
- **Unnamed** or **pseudonymous**
- **Unverifiable** by direct means
- **Credible only through contextual markers** (specific knowledge, detailed account, consistency, institutional markers)

**Credibility Factors:**
- Specific institutional knowledge demonstrated (not vague claims): Confidence 25-45%
- Consistent across multiple independent accounts: Confidence 15-40%
- Vague or unspecific claims: Confidence 5-20%
- No corroboration: Confidence 5-15%

**Example:** "Anonymous source claiming [testimony]. Credibility assessment: demonstrates specific institutional knowledge consistent with [detail], but unverifiable; confidence: 30%."

### Sourcing Rules for T4

1. **Distinguish Named from Anonymous**
   - T4_named: Always cite credentials and verify identity
   - T4_anon: Assess credibility through contextual markers, not claims alone

2. **Assess Corroboration**
   - T4 directly contradicting T1/T2: Treat as competing hypothesis, not primary evidence
   - T4 consistent with T1/T2: Adds detail; confidence highest
   - T4 uncontradicted but uncorroborated: Use cautiously; note isolation

3. **Identify Motivation & Bias**
   - What incentive does the witness have to tell truth or false story?
   - What is the witness's institutional affiliation or political position?
   - Would the witness benefit from a particular narrative?

4. **Never Aggregate Anonymous Testimony**
   - "Multiple anonymous sources say X" is not meaningful
   - Aggregate only if individual accounts are independently corroborated or demonstrate specific knowledge
   - Each anonymous account must be assessed individually

5. **Distinguish Testimony from Interpretation**
   - T4 fact: "I saw [specific observation]"
   - T4 interpretation: "This means [analysis]"
   - Use only facts; note when witness is interpreting vs. observing

### When T4 is Appropriate
- **Insider Perspective**: Testimony provides specific details not in T1/T2
- **Context**: Understanding institutional culture, decision-making, incentives
- **Corroboration**: Filling details confirmed by T1/T2
- **Novel Information**: Testimony pointing to information not yet in T1/T2

### When T4 is NOT Appropriate
- **Core Contested Claims**: Do not build analysis on T4 alone if T1/T2 is available
- **Uncontradicted but Unsupported**: T4 lacking T1/T2 baseline should be marked as speculation
- **Vague or Unspecific**: Anonymous claims without institutional markers are unreliable

### Citation Format
```
[T4_named: individual_name, credentials, professional_history, as_of: YYYY-MM-DD,
motivation_assessment: X, corroboration_status: Y, confidence: Z%]

[T4_anon: contextual_markers, as_of: YYYY-MM-DD, institutional_knowledge_demonstrated: Y/N,
corroboration_status: X, confidence: Z%]
```

**Example Citations:**
```
[T4_named: John Smith, Former Deputy Director of Agency X (2015-2020), verified professional
history, as_of: 2024-06-15, motivation: neutral/retired, corroboration: consistent with T1
declassified document S1, confidence: 45%]

[T4_anon: testimony describing specific procurement procedures at Institution Y, demonstrates
institutional knowledge, consistent across two independent accounts, as_of: 2024-08-20,
corroboration: procedures confirmed by T3 policy document, confidence: 35%]
```

## Source Conflict Resolution

When sources from different tiers conflict, use this hierarchy **unless domain context suggests otherwise**:

### Default Hierarchy
1. **T1 > T2**: Primary evidence overrides research findings (but note the conflict)
2. **T2 > T3**: Peer-reviewed research overrides secondary analysis (but note if reputable T3 reaches different conclusion)
3. **T3 > T4**: Established secondary sources override testimony (but note if T4 has specific knowledge)
4. **More Recent > Older** (within same tier): Newer evidence overrides outdated sources, unless older sources are explicitly still valid

### Context Exceptions
- **T1 Reliability**: If T1 source is known to be unreliable (e.g., propaganda ministry), lower its weight
- **T2 Domain Fit**: If T2 source is outside author's domain expertise, weight it lower than T1/T3 in that domain
- **T3 Credibility**: If T3 source has track record of misinformation, weight lower than T4_named with credentials
- **T4 Specificity**: If T4_named has direct specific knowledge contradicting T1/T2, note the contradiction as a possible error or revision in earlier sources

### Explicit Conflict Handling
```
CONFLICT DETECTED:
T1 Source A: [Claim X]
T2 Source B: [Contradicts Claim X]
T4_named Source C: [Supports Claim X]

Resolution:
Default hierarchy (T1 > T2, T2 > T4) suggests Claim X is correct, but contradiction is significant.
Confidence in Claim X: 70% [T1 support] with caveat [T2 and T4 contradiction noted].
Recommendation: Investigate why T2/T4 contradict T1 (error in T2, error in T1, updated information, etc.)
```

2. **Source identifier** (author, agency, journal, etc.)
3. **Date created** (when was source created/published)
4. **Date accessed** (when was source reviewed for this analysis)
5. **Confidence level** (as percentage, X%)
